{# Prompt template for the Repo Composer agent #}
You are an AI assistant tasked with initializing a new software project repository.

Based on the following high-level architecture plan, generate an initial project structure, including key directories and files (like a main application file, README, and CI pipeline stub).

Architecture Plan:
{{ architecture_plan }}

Provide the output as a JSON object with a "files" list. Each list entry should be an object containing:
- "path": the file path (including directories if any)
- "content": the text content of the file

Ensure the JSON is valid. Include at least:
- A main application entry point (e.g., `main.py`)
- A README.md with project description
- A continuous integration config stub (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Any important configuration or module files suggested by the architecture.
